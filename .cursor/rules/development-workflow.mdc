# Development Workflow

This project uses Nix with flakes for development environment setup. The flake configuration is in [flake.nix](mdc:flake.nix).

## Development Environment Setup

1. Ensure you have Nix with flakes enabled
2. Use direnv to automatically load the development environment:

```bash
# Enable direnv hook in your shell
eval "$(direnv hook bash)" # or zsh, fish, etc.

# Enter the project directory (direnv will automatically load the environment)
cd openai
```

## Testing

The test suite is in the `tasty/` directory. Run tests with:

```bash
cabal test
```

Test data is located in `tasty/data/`.

## Adding New OpenAI API Endpoints

When adding a new OpenAI API endpoint:

1. Create a new module in `src/OpenAI/V1/` for the endpoint
2. Define the request and response types
3. Add the endpoint to the Servant API in [src/OpenAI/V1.hs](mdc:src/OpenAI/V1.hs)
4. Add the corresponding method to the `Methods` record
5. Add tests in the `tasty/` directory

## Documentation

Keep documentation in module headers up to date. Use Haddock syntax for documenting functions, types, and modules.
