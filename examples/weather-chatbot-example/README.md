# Weather Chatbot Example

This example demonstrates how to create a chatbot using the OpenAI Haskell library with tool calling functionality. The chatbot can respond to weather queries by calling a mock weather tool.

## Features

- **Tool Calling**: Demonstrates how to define and use tools with the OpenAI API
- **Turn-based Chat**: Interactive chatbot that maintains conversation context
- **Multiple Tool Calls**: The LLM can make multiple tool calls before responding to the user
- **Mock Data**: Uses stub weather data for demonstration purposes

## Setup

1. Make sure you have an OpenAI API key set as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
   ```

2. Build the example:

   ```bash
   cabal build weather-chatbot-example
   ```

3. Run the example:
   ```bash
   cabal run weather-chatbot-example
   ```

## Usage

Once running, you can interact with the weather chatbot:

```

Available cities: London, Paris, Tokyo, New York, San Francisco
